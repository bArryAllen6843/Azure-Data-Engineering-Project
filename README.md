# Azure-Data-Engineering-Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Olympic Games data using various Azure services to create a robust data engineering pipeline. The main objectives were to determine which team has won the highest number of gold medals and to calculate the average number of male and female participants across different Olympic disciplines.

## Technologies Used

- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Apache Spark
- SQL

## Project Architecture

The project follows a modern data engineering architecture using Azure cloud services. Here's an overview of the data flow:

1. Data ingestion and storage in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
2. Data transformation and processing using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks
3. Data analysis and querying using Azure Synapse Analytics


## Detailed Process Flow

### 1. Data Ingestion with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

- Raw Olympic data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Provides a scalable and secure solution for storing large volumes of data
- Enables easy access for subsequent processing steps

### 2. Data Transformation with Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks

#### Azure Data Factory
- Orchestrates the data flow between different Azure services
- Triggers Databricks notebooks for data processing
- Manages dependencies and scheduling of data pipeline tasks


#### Azure Databricks
- Utilizes Apache Spark for large-scale data processing
- Performs data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation tasks
- Implements complex analytical operations using PySpark

Key operations performed:
- Calculating total gold medals per team
- Computing average participation by gender for each Olympic discipline


### 3. Data Analysis with Azure Synapse Analytics

- Serves as the final destination for processed data
- Enables complex SQL queries for in-depth analysis
- Provides a unified experience for big data and data warehousing

Key analyses performed:
- Identifying the team with the highest gold medal count
- Analyzing trends in male and female participation across disciplines
